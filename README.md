# Sudoko_Solver
This is a Python-based Sudoku solver that can solve any valid Sudoku puzzle using a backtracking algorithm. The program takes a partially filled Sudoku grid and returns a completed grid.


## Features
- Solves any valid Sudoku puzzle (9x9 grid).
- Implements backtracking algorithm for an efficient solution.
- Provides a visual representation of the solved Sudoku grid.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required (pure Python implementation).

## How It Works
- The solver uses the backtracking algorithm, a form of depth-first search. It starts with the first empty cell and tries to place a number (1â€“9) in that cell.
- If it finds a valid number that doesn't violate Sudoku rules (no duplicates in the row, column, or 3x3 subgrid), it moves to the next empty cell. If it hits a dead-end, it backtracks to the previous cell and tries the next number.
